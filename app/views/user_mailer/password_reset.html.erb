<h1>Password reset</h1>

<p>To reset your password click the link below:</p>

<%= link_to "Reset Password", edit_password_reset_url(@user.reset_token, email: @user.email) %>

<p>This link will expire in two hours. If you do not reset your password in that time you will have to restart the process.</p>

<p>Once your password is reset, please log into Check-In from within the LCBC mobile app to ensure that your account will stay logged in when using the LCBC app. This way, future check-ins will be just a click away.</p>
