To reset your password click the link below:

<%= edit_password_reset_url(@user.reset_token, email: @user.email) %>

This link will expire in two hours. If you do not reset your password in that time you will have to restart the process.

Once your password is reset, please log into Check-In from within the LCBC mobile app to ensure that your account will stay logged
in when using the LCBC app. This way, future check-ins will be just a click away.

If you did not request your password to be reset, please ignore this email and your password will stay as it is.
